    - Its important to note that you will have to use the associated trigram used by nanopool
    - Must be in lowercase in the script

#Goal
I did this script because i wanted 
- To see only usefull data ( To me )
- To organize the data the way i want it to be
- Gather other data from other sources in one screen ( not in this particular script but in others i haven't finished yet )
- To check if statistics computed by nanopool are right by comparing them with the collected data in real time ( It does match btw XD )
- Mabybe other ideas but i don't yet and i'll let you know when i would have find out =)

#Example
